## Introduction

A Snake game powered by the Lille game framework.

## Requirements

* Git
* Java 1.7 or higher (Oracle or OpenJDK recommended).
* Maven.

## Installation and Running

Start by cloning this repository, the "Lille Game Framework" is added as a sub-module so you will have to use this command:

`git clone --recursive git://github.com:LeRangDuFond/serpentin.git`.

If you have already cloned this repository or the command above isn't working:

```
git clone git://github.com:LeRangDuFond/serpentin.git
cd serpentin
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Compiling the framework and the game is done with the `mvn test` command at the root of this repository.

To play the game, just type `java -jar serpentin-game/target/serpentin-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` (if you are under Windows, replace the slashes by backslashes), if you are already in the `serpentin-game` directory, remove it from the command.

Enjoy playing our prototype!
